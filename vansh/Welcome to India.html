        <h2>Welcome to India</h2>
        <p>India, officially the Republic of India (Hindi: Bhārat Gaṇarājya),[23] is a country in South Asia. It is the
            second-most populous country, the seventh-largest country by area, and the most populous democracy in the
            world.
            Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the
            southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west;[f] China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and
            Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the
            Maldives;
            its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia.

            Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago.[24] Their long
            occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse,
            second only to Africa in human genetic diversity.[25] Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the
            western
            margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of
            the
            third millennium BCE.[26] </p>
